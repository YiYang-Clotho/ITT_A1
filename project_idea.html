							<h1 class="major">Project Idea</h1>
							<p>
								<h2 class="major">Overview</h2>
								It always happens that people may encounter a special but strange plant or animal on the road or in the wild. Even though there are some search engines with image recognition functions, they are not accurate enough for identifying specific plant or animal species. So I hope to develop an application based on image recognition and machine learning technology, so that people can search and know through pictures or describe animal/plant habits when they encounter unknown species.
								<br><br>
							</p>
							
                            <p>
								<h2 class="major">Motivation</h2>
								On the Chinese social network platform Weibo, an editor of National Geographic magazine has been doing a job. Netizens sometimes encounter strange creatures but don’t know or have channels to search for relevant knowledge. This editor’s job is to answer the doubts of netizens and to popularize science related information on the habits of animals and plants, growth environment, growth area and so on. Netizens’ questions are sometimes tricky, because some creatures are really rare, but the editor has done his best to help netizens with his excellent abilities, which is impressive. This incident inspired me. Can there be an application that combines image recognition, machine learning and the knowledge of experts, so that people can learn about the animals and plants they want to know by searching for pictures?	
								<br><br>
							</p>
								<h2 class="major">Description</h2>
								Although there may be many areas that need to be improved, I think the application should include the following basic functions. The main feature is that users are able to upload pictures of plants, animals or insects then they can get the detailed information of the organism. In addition to introducing basic information such as name, species, appearance description, it also introduces knowledge of species' habits, growing areas, and how to identify them as well as adding a relative wikipedia link about the species into the page. Some professionals will be hired to make sure of the accuracy of the content and information. Users could also directly communicate with the experts using the chatting box when the system shows that the professionals are available. They could also leave a message and wait for the reply when the experts are not available. Meanwhile, if the user finds any mistake in the content. They are able to send a report to the system to show their response or remind people to correct it. After review by the experts, if users’ are correct, their responses will be added to the corresponding page and they will be signed. The act of attribution can increase the enthusiasm of users, help contribute to the application while making users feel more involved, which can further improve the user stickiness of the app. On the homepage, to broaden users’ knowledge, the system will show a daily recommendation species which is common but people may not easily recognise. Also, the application will provide a community that allows people sharing their photos to communicate with others or with experts on related plants and animals. The community is different from the chatting box because the chatting box is for users to talk with experts directly and the answer will be professional but in the community, a large number of people could talk about one topic in the post. About the assessment, users can use the search function and can see the daily recommendation without signing up if they do not think it is necessary. They are able to go through the community’s contents and posts without signing up but if they want to post something or reply to others, they have to sign up and sign in. The positioning of this application is light, concise and easy to operate, and there is no need to add too many additional functions because it will make the application bulky. The main purpose of the application is to facilitate users to search for species through pictures, and redundant functions will make users feel cumbersome and reduce the number of users.

                            <p>
								<h2 class="major">Tools and Technologies</h2>
								In order to ensure that the software can be used, users should have fewer mobile phones or computers connected to the Internet to achieve search functions. On the other hand, in order to ensure that the software covers the three platforms of Android, Apple, and the web, developers need to use multiple languages and tools to develop software for different platforms. What language to use to develop this requires further research, because at this stage it is only showing preliminary ideas about the project, and further deciding how to develop the software requires user research and writing requirements reports. However, the language tools required for development such as C++ and Python for back-end development and HTML and CSS for front-end design, and cloud services such as AWS or Google Cloud are essential for deployment.
								<br><br>
							</p>
                            
							<p>
								<h2 class="major">Skills Required</h2>
								The project covers the three platforms of Android, Apple and Web, so the required technology needs to meet the development needs of these three platforms. If conditions permit, three different development teams may be required to develop simultaneously for three platforms. For Android development, we can use Android Studio. For Apple development, you can use the built-in Xcloud of Apple's computer. Web-side development can choose the front-end, back-end and database languages more freely. For example, python is very suitable for machine learning technology as a back-end tool. Related to the field of machine learning, the database can use MySQL, the front-end uses HTML and CSS as the basis, and Vue and JavaScript assist in linking data.
								<br><br>
							</p>

							<p>
								<h2 class="major">Outcome</h2>
								If the project is successful, I believe there will be many people who can satisfy their curiosity while gaining additional knowledge and broadening their knowledge. The realization of this project may make people notice the common but distinctive animals and plants in life, make people notice the scenery around them, and let people pay attention to life and experience life after work and study. If I participate in the development of this project, even if there is not much connection to the game development-related work I expect, I believe that many technical applications are interoperable, which will allow me to increase my development experience.
