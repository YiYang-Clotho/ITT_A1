							<h3>Where it started?</h3>
							<p>
								My major was mathematics when I entered university, but at that time I didn’t have much passion in mathematics. I subconsciously think that the process of learning mathematics may be very boring. At the same time, I saw that the university has a project in cooperation with RMIT, so I started to learn computer science then major in Information technology in RMIT. At the beginning, what attracted me was its creativity. With the development of industry, people's lives are increasingly inseparable from mobile phones. China’s software industry is also developing rapidly. Shopping software and social software are flooding people’s lives. At first I felt that if I could participate in the development of a certain software, the things I created could be used by others in their daily lives. It will be a proud thing. Later, with the deepening of learning, I gradually felt that what attracted me to IT was the process of problem solving, exploration and research.
							</p>
							<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
							<p>
								I chose RMIT because of the geographical location of the school. RMIT is located in the city center of Melbourne, which makes the students' extracurricular life richer and will not be bothered by long commutes. On the other hand, RMIT not only pays attention to academic research, but also ensures that what students learn can be integrated with industry, so that students can consolidate knowledge and skills in practice, which also provide students with advantages in finding jobs.
							</p>
							<h3>Expectation</h3>
							<p>
								I expect to be more knowledgeable in coding after my studies at RMIT that helps change the world for the better. I cannot confirm what kind of job I would like to do in the future, maybe I will be a software engineer to develop a software that attracts people, possibly I will work on network security to protect the rights of users and the company, I may also participate in game production and create popular games. In any case, I hope to improve my coding ability and create something valuable and meaningful
